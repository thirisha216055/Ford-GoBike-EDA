## Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Ford GoBike dataset. The goal is to understand usage patterns, demographic trends, and other key insights that can be derived from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on Ford GoBike trips, including:
- Trip durations
- Start and end station locations
- User types (e.g., Subscriber, Customer)
- User demographics (e.g., gender, age)
- Time and date of trips

The dataset can be obtained from [Ford GoBike's official website](https://www.fordgobike.com) or any other relevant source where it is publicly available.

## Analysis Goals
The primary objectives of this analysis include:
- Identifying peak usage times and locations.
- Analyzing user demographics and their impact on bike-sharing behavior.
- Exploring trip duration trends and patterns.
- Generating visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
