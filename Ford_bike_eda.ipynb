        "The objective of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Ford GoBike dataset to understand user behavior, trip durations, and seasonal trends. After cleaning the data and engineering new features like month, weekday, and hour, we analyzed patterns across various dimensions. We found that the average trip duration is around 12.5 minutes, with customers (casual riders) generally taking longer trips than subscribers (commuters). Most trips occur during weekday commuting hours (morning and evening).\n",

        "Interestingly, trip duration showed only minor variations across different months, suggesting that seasonality has a limited impact on trip behavior. The findings highlight clear differences between user types, offering business opportunities to target marketing strategies towards converting casual customers into long-term subscribers and optimizing service during peak commuting times."
